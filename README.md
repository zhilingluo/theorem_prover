# theorem_prover
Contributing to formal theorem proving in GitHub repos

## Goal
- Contributing theorem proving to [Lean-Matrix-Cookbook](https://github.com/eric-wieser/lean-matrix-cookbook) 
- Contributing theorem proving in [PrimeNumberTheoremAnd](https://github.com/AlexKontorovich/PrimeNumberTheoremAnd)

## Roadmap
1) Basic architecture: 
   2) Lean-dojo + searching + enhanced LLM for lean theorem proving, verify it on simple benchmarks: minif2f
   3) a solution to translate informal theorem into formal one (in Lean 4)
2) Key questions: to be explored

## Process

The process is [Here](/history.md)

My LLM proved 13 theorems of 30 in minif2f. üëèüèª
